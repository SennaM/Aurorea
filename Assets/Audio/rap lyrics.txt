Aurorea the game yea you’ve probably heard of it

You are an astronaut and in your rocket you’re skirtin’ it

You go from planet to planet and you go mining and farming 

We got you vibin’ to the music and zero planets you’re harming


Got three devs up on the mic and we be spitting these bars

Feeling like mafia bosses yea we smokin’ cigars

We put the work and put the time in to go up to the stars

Put the rocket on full power yea we going to mars


You are the last survivor of the end of the world

The game is so addicting yea we got you feeling whirled

We got you up till 5 a.m. And your parents are mad

And when you wake and see your grades you’ll be feeling sad


You got your best friend panandroid yea he’s the world's smartest android

He's always there if you need him yea he saved you from the void

He’s always in your rocket making sure your alive

In my opinion he's better than the ps5

Your rocket is all yours yeah you can do what you want

If it was in a competition he would get better than bronze


You got your chair, mattress, airlock and you got your own table

Every rocket is special they've got coaxial cables

It’s not a project for school but it’s a project for fun

We all like making games. Are there regrets? none

We started working on it when we were in grade nine

And now were done and the boys should make us a shrine
